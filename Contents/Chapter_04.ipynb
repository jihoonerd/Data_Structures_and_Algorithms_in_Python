    "In general, an algorithm that sues recursion typically has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Test for base cases\n",
    "\n",
    "  We begin by testing for a set of base cases (there should be at least one). These base cases should be defined so that every possible chain of recursive calls will eventually reach a base case, \n",

    "  \n",

    "  If not a base case, we perform one or more recursive calls. This recursive step may involve a test that decides which of several possible recursive \n",
    "  calls to make. We should define each possible recursive call so that it makes progress towards a base case.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Parameterizing a Recursion\n",
    "To design a recursive algorithm for a given problem, it is useful to think of the different ways we might define subproblems that have the same general structure as the original problem. \n",

    "`bianry_search(data, target)`, the only way to invoke a search on half the list would have been to make a new list instance with only those elements to send as the first parameter. However, making a copy of half the list would already \n",

    "\n",
    "If we wished to provide a cleaner public interface to an algorithm like binary search, without bothering a user with extra \n",

    "The main benefit of a recursive approach to algorithm design is that it allows us to succintly take adavantage of a repetitive structure present in many problems.\n",
    "By making our algorithm description exploit the repetitive structure in a recursive way, we can often avoid complex case analyes and nested loops. \n",
    "This approach can lead to more readable algorithm descriptions, while stil being quite efficient.\n",

    "However, the usefulness of recursion comes at a modest cost. In particular the Python interpreter must maintain activation recors that keep track of the state of each nested cell. \n",
    "When computer memory is at a premium, it is useful in some cases to be able to derive nonrecursive algorithms from recursive ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we can use the stack data structure to convert a recursive algorithm into a nonrecursive algorithm by managing the nesting of the recursive structure ourselves, rather than relying on the \n",
